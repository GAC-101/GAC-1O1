  <ol class="tips">
    <li class="tips">If the name of the author is not included in the article you are using, write "n.a." in the space where the name of the author goes.</li>
    <li class="tips">If the date is not included in the article you are using, write "n.d." in the space where the date goes.</li>
    <li class="tips">Once you have a perfect web page reference, use that as a template for future ones.</li>
    <li class="tips">When you are going to choose your article, make sure to seek out all the information you need to include in your reference in the article before you use it for your report, assessment, etc.</li>
    <li class="tips">Use the short version of the URL of the page in order to make it shorter and easier to read.</li>
  </ol>
   <h3 id="h3">Tips for Assessments</h3>
   <ol class="tips">
     <li class="tips">Make sure to mark all of the dates of your final deliveries and draft deliveries of your assessments in your calendar in order to help you organize better.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember to <strong><u>always</u></strong> use the GAC template for your assessments.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember to always include the header and footer on all of the pages in your document, except for the cover page.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember that each GAC course has a different 000 termination, and each assessment has a different number assigned, for example: GAC011 Assessment Event 1: Website Storyboard.</li>
     <li class="tips">To avoid stress and pressure, divide a long assessment into parts and complete one or two parts each day rather than doing everything one or two days before the final delivery.</li>
     <li class="tips">Final assessments are usually not that far apart in time; for example, you may need to deliver a biology assessment and a public speaking assessment two days later; as a result, try to start the assessment on the same day the teacher finished explaining it in order to have more time to do it and organize better.</li>
   </ol>
  <h3 id="h3">Tips for New Students</h3>
  <ol class="tips">
    <li class="tips">GAC can be a little overwhelming, especially on exam week, so remember that it's okay to take little breaks while you study or work in order to take care of yourself for a couple minutes.</li>
    <li class="tips">When you download the GAC manuals given by your teacher, change the manual's name to the name of the course in order to have an easier time finding them on your computer.</li>
    <li class="tips">Create Google Drive folders for each of the courses and upload all of your work, documents, etc. for each course in them in order to have a better organization and an easier time looking for specific documents from specific courses when your teacher asks for them as evidence.</li>
    <li class="tips">Create a good sleeping schedule.</li>
    <li class="tips">Make notes of the comments your teacher makes when they are explaining assessments, since this will help you when you are working on them.</li>
