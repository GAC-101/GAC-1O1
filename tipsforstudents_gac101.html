  <h3 id="h3">Tips for Referencing</h3>
  <ol class="tips">
    <li class="tips">If the name of the author is not included in the article you are using, write “n.a.” in the space where the name of the author goes.</li>
    <li class="tips">If the date is not included in the article you are using, write “n.d.” in the space where the date goes.</li>
    <li class="tips">Once you have a perfect web page reference, use that as a template for future ones.</li>
    <li class="tips">When you are going to chose your article, make sure to seek for all the information you need to include in your reference in the article before you use it for your report, assessment, etc.</li>
    <li class="tips">Use the short version of the URL of the page in order to make them shorter and easier to read.</li>
  </ol>
   <h3 id="h3">Tips for Assessments</h3>
   <ol class="tips">
     <li class="tips">Make sure to mark all of the date of your final deliveries and draft deliveries of your assessments in your calendar in order to help you organize better.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember to <strong><u>always</u></strong> use the GAC template for your assessments.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember to always include header and footer in all of the pages in your document, except for the cover page.</li>
     <li class="tips">Remember that each GAC course has a different 000 termination, and each assessment has a different number assigned, example: GAC011 Assessment Event 1: Website Storyboard.</li>
     <li class="tips">When doing a long assessment try to divide it in parts and do one or two parts each day instead of doing everything 1 or 2 days before the final delivery in order to keep you from stress and pressure.</li>
     <li class="tips">Assessments final deliveries are usually not that far apart from each other, an example of this is that you would need to deliver a biology assessment and two days after that, deliver a public speaking assessment, because of this, try to always start the assessment the same day the teacher finished explaining it in order to have more time to do it and organize better.</li>
   </ol>
  <h3 id="h3">Tips for New Students</h3>
  <ol class="tips">
    <li class="tips">GAC can be a little overwhelming, especially on exams week, so remember is okay to take little breaks while you study/work, in order to take care of yourself for a couple minutes.</li>
    <li class="tips">When you download the GAC manuals given by your teacher, change the manuals name to the name of the course in order to have an easier time finding them on your computer.</li>
    <li class="tips">Create Google Drive folders for each of the courses and upload all of your work, documents, etc. of each course in them in order to have a better organization and have an easier time looking for specific documents of specific courses when your teacher asks for them as evidence.</li>
    <li class="tips">Create a good sleeping schedule.</li>
    <li class="tips">Make notes of the comments your teacher mentions when they are explaining assessments since this will help you when you are working on it.</li>
